# Juglone-Resistance
  Updated 1 minute ago    For this project, we will look at data from fallingfruit.org for the Austin area and try and find edible plant species that are resistant to Juglone, the major compound in leaves from the Juglanacae (Walnut) family. Walnut, pecan and hickory trees contain a compound called Juglone that is shed onto other plants in the fall. This kills many plants and allows their own saplings to thrive.  
  
  More information on Juglone: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juglone  
  
  Morton Arboretum from Chicago has an extensive list of Juglone tolerant plants: https://hort.extension.wisc.edu/articles/black-walnut-toxicity/  
  
  We are hoping to discover some new species that may have been overlooked by studies or have acquired resistance recently.
